      <p>I'm alive!</p>

<p>A few years back and I never would have thought of making a blog. The whole concept of writing in an area where no one dwells upon is mysterious and intriguing. It forced the question I had to answer for myself, who am I really writing for? I kept asking, all the bloggers out there, all the content writers, why did they write? I knew some wrote for fun, whereas others wrote for themselves. Here's my take on why I started my blog, and why I personally write.</p>

<p>It wasn't until recently, that I realised not everything needed a specific purpose. Articles that are written don't need an immediate effect on the world or anyone, for that fact. Just because something is unknown, doesn't mean that it is of no value, an example being tutorials. I see many of these tutorials, buried away in the abyss and having never been seen by anyone. It doesn't matter that no one has currently seen it, that isn't important. In fact, if it was written to be seen then a blog won't be as effective as other sources. What is important is that someone, whether it be one person or a few, will see it eventually, whether by accident or on purpose. It is at that time that it will gain value.</p>

<p>Those tutorials I stumbled upon, they were from various other bloggers who didn't have a big audience. But did that matter? Those tutorials were of value to me, they provided information that I needed and I am thankful for that. I plan to write on this blog about my experiences while I went through programming or just life in general. Whether or not it is seen is of no matter, but if my posts help others with their problems then it's all for the better.</p>
