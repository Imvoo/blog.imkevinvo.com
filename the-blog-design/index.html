      <p>Homepages are interesting places. Usually they feature some sort of item, or are used to convey ideas to others, but for me it was more of a way to describe who I was as a person.</p>

<p>A landing page's design reflects an individual's sense of design and well, my sense of design has changed for the better over the course of my life. I look back to some designs I made in the past and those designs at the time were perfect in my own eyes, but of course when I look back to them now I see a lot of errors. Who am I kidding, those designs were pretty bad at that point in time, but it is from those designs which have developed my understanding of creativity which bring me to where I am today.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/FPYYXM0.png" alt="My first landing page."></p>

<p>This is the first landing page that I created (~2014). It was simple and that's what I liked about it at the time, but there were a few issues already present in the image. First of all, the text rendering on it was for some reason not quite right. The edges look very jagged so it might be a problem with the font I used (Oswald) but I'm not too sure. Alongside that, I loved using negative letter-spacing which may have looked nice at the time, however leads to readability issues later on.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vOKlubq.png" alt="My second landing page."></p>

<p>This was the second design I came up with. I had just discovered the use of stock photos to 'enhance' my landing page's design and I was into the glass aspect of many things, including Windows Aero's glass taskbars and such. I didn't have too much of a problem with this design, however it was slowly drifting away from my original idea of my homepage, which was a simplistic representation of myself. The stock photo also didn't really convey anything, so that was quite useless although it looked nice.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YorwrUt.png" alt="My current landing page."></p>

<p>Ah, finally onto my current landing page. It takes the overall theme of my first landing page design and adapts upon that. I took what I had learned already about design and from that, this version of my landing page was formed. Some of these ideas helped me with the page itself, for example I stuck by the idea that <strong>white-space is key for clarity</strong>. I give everything a lot of breathing room so that it's not too crowded with information and so your eyes can move from one section of the page to another easily. </p>

<p>I also <strong>under-utilized colours</strong> on the page as colour is a very difficult concept to work with design-wise. This was taken from <a href="https://medium.com/@erikdkennedy/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-1-559d4e805cda?hn=1">7 Rules for creating gorgeous UI</a> by Erik D Kennedy. In his second rule, he states <strong>black and white first</strong>, then afterwards add colour. This helps to add an accent to the page and I guess keep the design clean, as over-usage of colours results in your brain trying to interpret too many ideas at once. This is evident in my second landing page, where the stock photo distracts the user from what the landing page is actually trying to portray/show.</p>

<p>This design is by no means the last design I will create, as design is always open for improvement and as I improve I will start to notice problems in my own design. For now however, I'm content with what I've made and only time will tell how well the page ages.</p>
