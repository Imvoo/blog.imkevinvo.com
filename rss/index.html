<p>As a developer starting off in the game development industry, one of the biggest challenges anyone faces is creating a game. This is already a huge task in itself, which is why most game developers often turn towards a game engine to help speed up this process instead of constructing their own game engine. There are many existing game engines today that provide the underlying framework and tools to create games, which means game developers have less to worry about and can instead focus on what’s more important; the final end product, their completed game.</p>

<p>Some of the most popular game engines today are Unity and Unreal Engine, both of which were paid software but have since recently been free to use (up to a certain point) <strong>(1)</strong>. With games like Street Fighter V, Killing Floor 2 and XCOM being released on Unreal and games like Hearthstone, Cities Skylines and Firewatch being released in Unity it goes to show that these engines are in fact capable of producing high quality games for studios large and small. Unity and Unreal are considered more ‘feature complete’ game engines, in that they bundle almost all the aspects and features you would need to create your own game in their own engine.</p>

<p>There are several smaller/more barebone game engines that exist as well, such as GameMaker <strong>(2)</strong>. These smaller game engines usually serve a different purpose or are less restricted in other areas in comparison to more feature complete engines. Complete game engines for instance let you create any game you wish as they include all the tools for you to do so, smaller game engines on the other hand are usually tailored towards a specific game style or game type so that those wishing to create a game tailored to a specific genre have more specific tools and features to do so. They also generally differentiate in some aspects from complete game engines such as licensing, cost and 2D/3D which gives game developers more options in terms of what game engine they should use.</p>

<h2 id="godot">Godot</h2>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/iuWuzve.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Godot is a game engine that has recently started to grow in popularity, reaching 3rd place in GitHub’s game engine showcase with 8,000 stars <strong>(3)</strong>. Godot was previously an in house game engine used by companies in America <strong>(4)</strong> but has since been open sourced to the community in 2014. Now, it is being actively developed on by the community and two of the original Godot creators, Juan Linietsky and Ariel Manzur to create a free, cross platform engine.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LwhH52p.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Godot aims to be a cross-platform game engine that is completely free and is community driven/developed <strong>(5)</strong>. It is targeted towards 2D and 3D games however as the 3D aspect of Godot is still being developed over time, the 2D aspect is generally used by most of the community. To interact with Godot itself, a custom language called GDScript is used which has a custom syntax very similar to that of Python. The Godot team decided to use GDScript as they had encountered a lot of problems over the years with other scripting languages <strong>(6)</strong>. Lua integration for example was extremely complex and took a lot of code, and Python bindings were difficult to embed into their own solution. With GDScript on the other hand, they were able to create the language in such a way that their design implementation of ‘nodes’ (covered later on) works and so the language is more tied into the game engine itself, so that it is native to Godot.</p>

<p>Godot was designed to be easy to use for newcomers and also for those who have used game engines before. The user interface is similar to Unity’s UI and also supports many features such as drag-and-drop functionality for nodes in the scene and live scene editing. By using GDScript, there are some initial barriers of entry but as it is similar to Python and is a scripting language, it is easy to dive into once the basics have been learned. Finally, as the editor itself is cross-platform (Windows, MacOS and Linux support), developers can work in the same editor across all their development environments.</p>

<p>Godot itself uses a node-based system for everything in the game. Whether it be scenes, objects or tiles inside your game, everything is a node which can have multiple child nodes and can inherit other nodes. This lets you add what you want to objects easily and intuitively. For instance, if your sprite/image node needs collision in the world, you can make the parent node a PhysicsBody which would then add collision to your sprite. With that, you can also add other nodes you have previously defined to new nodes to create new levels. For example, you could have a few house nodes and add it to a town node, and then later on add the town node to a village. Godot in essence is a tree of nodes that will become the game you wish to design, and you can reuse/instantiate any amount of nodes and the nodes you need to create the scene(s) you wish. </p>

<p><img src="http://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/openworld_instancing.png" alt=""></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Godot comes with a custom inbuilt physics system that is tuned to work well in pixel-perfect 2D games (with kinematic and rigid bodies). There is also a built-in animation editor in the engine which lets you animate everything from properties on nodes to functions inside scripts as well. One of the animation methods is a cut-out system, whereby different parts of a sprite can be ‘cut-out’ and joined together in the animation editor with a skeleton. This skeleton can be used to link up all the parts of a sprite which then allows the developer to animate each body part individually. The body parts connected will then move together just like a real skeleton would (e.g. moving arms would also move the connected hand), making animating that much simpler for artists.</p>

<p>The best aspect of Godot however, is that it is also released under the MIT license and is open-source, which makes it completely free to use and edit! Many developers have been actively contributing to Godot’s source code to try and improve the game engine itself because of this, and as a result a new release of Godot (Godot 3.0) is planned to be released sometime later this year <strong>(8)</strong>. Embracing the open source community by releasing Godot on an MIT license means that if there are any bugs within the game engine itself, or if the game engine needs to be modified then it can as all the developers have access to the source code for the engine itself on Github and thus can make a pull request to improve Godot in the future.</p>

<p>As of today, Godot contains a lot of different nodes that can be used in both 2D and 3D games. However, due to the complexity of 3D techniques there is always improvements that can be made to 3D technology, and thus 3D in Godot is in a good state but nowhere near the 2D support that Godot provides. Ranging from the documentation on the website to the example projects (8 example 3D projects vs 28 example 2D projects) located on Github, Godot is primarily used by developers as a 2D game engine. The website contains a lot of extensive documentation on all the aspects of the Godot engine itself, and tutorials on how to create a simple game in 2D which will aid developers wanting to get started in Godot and developers wanting to create a 2D game.</p>

<p>Finally, working as a team on a Godot project is actually quite simple as a result of how Godot was designed. As a Godot game/scene consists of a tree of nodes within nodes, different developers can work on their own nodes in the game which can then be instantiated later on into other nodes to populate a scene. Thus, while one developer is working on the Player node, another can work on the Inventory node and another on the actual Map node itself where the player will be fighting. This separation allows nodes to be worked on independently and re-used later on when needed. Different types of developers can also work in the project too, level designers can utilize the drag-and-drop functionality to create their own level designs and artists can utilize the animation editor to animate their sprites/models. And, when finally syncing files into a version control system like Git, everything just works as there are no binary files, everything in Godot is stored in a text file format which is friendly to VCS systems, meaning teams of any size can work together and create their dream game.</p>

<p>Godot is a new engine that is improving by the day. Being easy to get into with its high-level scripting language GDScript, learning how to create a simple game can be an easy exercise with the extensive documentation on the website. With the extensive features Godot offers alongside its ‘node’ system, Godot can be a good option for those looking for a good 2D engine to work in and maybe even complete a full game in.</p>

<p>The influx of indie developers around the world continues to grow year by year as new technologies continue to be released and improved. It was just a few years ago that AAA game companies dominated the market, but now with game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine becoming free to use [1] for the whole community, the barrier of entry to game development is as low as ever.</p>

<p>Not only are development tools becoming free and easy to use, it is also becoming increasingly easier to distribute games to the community. <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a>, one of the main storefronts with over 125 million active users released Steam Greenlight in 2012 which allowed all developers to upload their games and have their submissions be accepted into the Steam Store after going through a voting process. Smaller distribution companies also started to emerge, such as the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store">Humble Store</a> with it's popular Humble Bundles to support charities and small game developers with a pay-what-you-want model. These companies allowed lesser-known games to spread and become more well aware in the community.</p>

<p>Many new indie game studios are now emerging and are popping up to take advantage of the slow release cycle of major games and showcase their own games to the world! Now is the best time to get started, but how does one get started in a field this big? Where do you go to, what resources are there to utilize? There are many opportunities in Australia to kickstart your game development career, and here are just a few of them!</p>

<h1 id="theaustraliangamedevrevolution">The Australian GameDev Revolution</h1>

<p>There are many different opportunities in Australia to start your own small/indie game development company! Firstly, in order to actually produce a game, you need a place to work. What other place is better than Melbourne's own collaborate studio, <a href="https://twitter.com/thearcademelb?lang=en">The Arcade</a>.</p>

<h2 id="thearcade">The Arcade</h2>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Lo2G0af.png" alt="The Arcade, Melbourne"></p>

</blockquote>

<p>The Arcade, located at <em>71-75 City Rd, Southbank, Victoria 3006</em> is a collaborative working space which houses many small indie game-dev companies all in one building. The rooms can be rented out for days (or months) at a rate of $28.60/day or $434.72/month according to <a href="https://www.theloop.com.au/creative_workspaces/The-Arcade/2542">The Loop</a>. Not only is this an inexpensive way of having a central location for all your developers to work, it can also be an amazing way of getting feedback for games you're working on and inspiration from others working on similar projects.</p>

<p>One of the prime examples of developer success is Crossy Road, a video game created by founders Matt Hall and Andy Sum of <a href="http://hipsterwhale.com/">Hipster Whale</a>. Originally intended for mobile devices, it is now played across the world by children and in arcades. Hipster Whale spent most of their time working in The Arcade and talking to others around them, which goes to show that this environment can house Australia's next best developers.</p>

<h2 id="filmvictoria">Film Victoria</h2>

<p>Having a space to work in is great, but space isn't the only thing new game-dev companies require. Having enough funds is just as important as having a space to work in, which is why <a href="https://www.film.vic.gov.au/">Film Victoria</a> released their <a href="https://www.film.vic.gov.au/funding/games-funding/">Games Funding initiative</a> to help support game developers produce and release games to the public.</p>

<p>Film Victoria allows game developers to apply for two grants: the <strong>Assigned Production Investment</strong> grant and the <strong>Games Release</strong> grant.</p>

<p>The <strong>Assigned Production Investment</strong> for games grant was created to allow game-dev companies to produce prototypes and full games while also handling some smaller tasks like marketing. The grant requires you to pay the non-refundable fee of $550 AUD initially, but afterwards allows your company to receive up to <strong>$150,000</strong> AUD (depending on the game itself) to help kickstart your game development so you don't have to focus on acquiring cash/funding.</p>

<p>The <strong>Games Release</strong> grant on the other hand is for games which are nearing completion. If received, the grant provides up to <strong>$30,000</strong> AUD for release related activites such as legal fees, marketing, licensing costs etc.</p>

<p>These grants allow anyone to start working on games which is what Film Victoria is pushing for, and is why Australia is a great place to start creating games.</p>

<p>Once you've finished creating your game, you need to showcase it for the world to see! <a href="http://aus.paxsite.com/">PAX Australia</a>, aka. the Penny Arcade Expo is an amazing event where many new and existing game developers come and showcase their games in their own boothes for the community to see. PAX occurs once a year for each 'region' (Aus, West/South/East), and it is the perfect time to measure how well your game does in terms of community reaction. With the three days spent at this expo, it will become extremely easy to gauge how much you need to improve in terms of developing the game itself and work out how much more marketing needs to be done to ensure that more games get well received.</p>

<h1 id="opportunitiesopportunities">Opportunities, opportunities</h1>

<p>There are so many resources that you can utilize as a game developer in Australia to kickstart your game development company or journey! Looking for a place where you can work or garner opinions? The Arcade is a great place to start with it's collaborative environment and cheap desk spaces. Looking for money to fund your business or yourself? Film Victoria will help you with two separate grants to assist in developing the game itself or releasing a game. Finally, need to quickly and effectively market your game? PAX Australia gathers many passionate gamers who want to explore new and interesting games, showcasing your game in a booth in PAX is definitely the best way to reveal it to the world. There is no better time to start than now, so what is everyone waiting for?</p>

Usually they feature some sort of item, or are used to convey ideas to others, but for me it was more of a way to describe who I was as a person.</p>

<p>A landing page's design reflects an individual's sense of design and well, my sense of design has changed for the better over the course of my life. I look back to some designs I made in the past and those designs at the time were perfect in my own eyes, but of course when I look back to them now I see a lot of errors. Who am I kidding, those designs were pretty bad at that point in time, but it is from those designs which have developed my understanding of creativity which bring me to where I am today.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/FPYYXM0.png" alt="Development of my Landing Page"></p>

<p>This is the first landing page that I created (~2014). It was simple and that's what I liked about it at the time, but there were a few issues already present in the image. First of all, the text rendering on it was for some reason not quite right. The edges look very jagged so it might be a problem with the font I used (Oswald) but I'm not too sure. Alongside that, I loved using negative letter-spacing which may have looked nice at the time, however leads to readability issues later on.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vOKlubq.png" alt="Development of my Landing Page"></p>

<p>This was the second design I came up with. I had just discovered the use of stock photos to 'enhance' my landing page's design and I was into the glass aspect of many things, including Windows Aero's glass taskbars and such. I didn't have too much of a problem with this design, however it was slowly drifting away from my original idea of my homepage, which was a simplistic representation of myself. The stock photo also didn't really convey anything, so that was quite useless although it looked nice.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YorwrUt.png" alt="Development of my Landing Page"></p>

<p>Ah, finally onto my current landing page. It takes the overall theme of my first landing page design and adapts upon that. I took what I had learned already about design and from that, this version of my landing page was formed. Some of these ideas helped me with the page itself, for example I stuck by the idea that <strong>white-space is key for clarity</strong>. I give everything a lot of breathing room so that it's not too crowded with information and so your eyes can move from one section of the page to another easily. </p>

<p>I also <strong>under-utilized colours</strong> on the page as colour is a very difficult concept to work with design-wise. This was taken from <a href="https://medium.com/@erikdkennedy/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-1-559d4e805cda?hn=1">7 Rules for creating gorgeous UI</a> by Erik D Kennedy. In his second rule, he states <strong>black and white first</strong>, then afterwards add colour. This helps to add an accent to the page and I guess keep the design clean, as over-usage of colours results in your brain trying to interpret too many ideas at once. This is evident in my second landing page, where the stock photo distracts the user from what the landing page is actually trying to portray/show.</p>

<p>This design is by no means the last design I will create, as design is always open for improvement and as I improve I will start to notice problems in my own design. For now however, I'm content with what I've made and only time will tell how well the page ages.</p>

<p>A few years back and I never would have thought of making a blog. The whole concept of writing in an area where no one dwells upon is mysterious and intriguing. It forced the question I had to answer for myself, who am I really writing for? I kept asking, all the bloggers out there, all the content writers, why did they write? I knew some wrote for fun, whereas others wrote for themselves. Here's my take on why I started my blog, and why I personally write.</p>

<p>It wasn't until recently, that I realised not everything needed a specific purpose. Articles that are written don't need an immediate effect on the world or anyone, for that fact. Just because something is unknown, doesn't mean that it is of no value, an example being tutorials. I see many of these tutorials, buried away in the abyss and having never been seen by anyone. It doesn't matter that no one has currently seen it, that isn't important. In fact, if it was written to be seen then a blog won't be as effective as other sources. What is important is that someone, whether it be one person or a few, will see it eventually, whether by accident or on purpose. It is at that time that it will gain value.</p>

<p>Those tutorials I stumbled upon, they were from various other bloggers who didn't have a big audience. But did that matter? Those tutorials were of value to me, they provided information that I needed and I am thankful for that. I plan to write on this blog about my experiences while I went through programming or just life in general. Whether or not it is seen is of no matter, but if my posts help others with their problems then it's all for the better.</p>
