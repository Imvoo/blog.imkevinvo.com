<p>The influx of indie developers around the world continues to grow year by year as new technologies continue to be released and improved. It was just a few years ago that AAA games dominated the market, but now with game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine becoming free to use [1] for the whole community, the barrier of entry to game development is as low as ever.</p>

<p>Not only are development tools becoming free and easy to use, it is also becoming increasingly easier to distribute games to the community. <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a>, one of the main storefronts with over 125 million active users released Steam Greenlight in 2012 which allowed all developers to upload their games and have their submissions be accepted into the Steam Store after going through a voting process. Smaller distribution companies also started to emerge, such as the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store">Humble Store</a> with it's popular Humble Bundles to support charities and small game developers with a pay-what-you-want model.</p>

<p>With that, many new indie game studios have emerged and are popping up to take advantage of the slow release cycle of major games and showcase their own games to the world! Now is the best time to get started, but how does one get started in a field this big? Where do you go to, what resources are there to utilize? There are many opportunities in Australia to kickstart your game development career, and here are just a few of them!</p>

<h1 id="theaustraliangamedevrevolution">The Australian GameDev Revolution</h1>

<p>There are many different opportunities in Australia to start your own small/indie game development company! Firstly, in order to actually produce a game, you need a place to work. What other place is better than Melbourne's own collaborate studio, <a href="https://twitter.com/thearcademelb?lang=en">The Arcade</a>.</p>

<h2 id="thearcade">The Arcade</h2>

<p>The Arcade, located at <em>71-75 City Rd, Southbank, Victoria 3006</em> is a collaborative working space which houses many small indie game-dev companies all in one building. The rooms can be rented out for days (or months) at a rate of $28.60/day or $434.72/month according to <a href="https://www.theloop.com.au/creative_workspaces/The-Arcade/2542">The Loop</a>. Not only is this an inexpensive way of having a central location for all your developers to work, it can also be an amazing way of getting feedback for games you're working on and inspiration from others working on similar projects.</p>

<p>One of the prime examples of developer success is Crossy Road, a video game created by founders Matt Hall and Andy Sum of <a href="http://hipsterwhale.com/">Hipster Whale</a>. Originally intended for mobile devices, it is now played across the world by children and in arcades. The Arcade was Hipster Whale's main work location, and goes to show that this environment can house Australia's next best developers.</p>

  <p>"You might be a one or two-person team, but when you're part of The Arcade it's like you've got dozens of helpers ready to assist with their expertise." - Ben Britten</p>

<p>Having a space to work in is great, but space isn't the only thing new game-dev companies require. Having enough funds is just as important as having a space to work in, which is why <a href="https://www.film.vic.gov.au/">Film Victoria</a> released their <a href="https://www.film.vic.gov.au/funding/games-funding/">Games Funding initiative</a> to help support game developers produce and release games to the public.</p>

<p>Film Victoria allows game developers to apply for two grants: the <strong>Assigned Production Investment</strong> grant and the <strong>Games Release</strong> grant.</p>

<p>The <strong>Assigned Production Investment</strong> for games grant was created to allow game-dev companies to produce prototypes and full games and also to handle some related activities; including marketing. The grant requires you to pay the non-refundable fee of $550 AUD initially, but afterwards allows your company to receive up to <strong>$150,000</strong> AUD (depending on the game itself) to help kickstart your game development so you don't have to focus on acquiring cash/funding.</p>

<p>The <strong>Games Release</strong> grant on the other hand is for games which are nearing completion. If received, the grant provides up to <strong>$30,000</strong> AUD for release related activites such as legal fees, marketing, licensing costs etc.</p>

<p>These grants allow anyone to start working on games which is what Film Victoria is pushing for, and is why Australia is a great place to start creating games.</p>

<p>Once you've finished creating your game, you need to showcase it for the world to see! <a href="http://aus.paxsite.com/">PAX Australia</a>, aka. the Penny Arcade Expo is an amazing event where many new and existing game developers come and showcase their games in their own boothes for the community to see. PAX occurs once a year for each 'region' (Aus, West/South/East), and it is the perfect time to measure how well your game does in terms of playability and work out how much you need to improve in terms of developing the game itself, and marketing.</p>

<h1 id="opportunitiesopportunities">Opportunities, opportunities</h1>

<p>There are so many resources that you can utilize as a game developer in Australia to kickstart your game development company or journey! Looking for a place where you can work or garner opinions? The Arcade is a great place to start with it's collaborative environment and cheap desk spaces. Looking for money to fund your business or yourself? Film Victoria will help you with two separate grants to assist in developing the game itself or releasing a game. Finally, need to quickly and effectively market your game? PAX Australia gathers many passionate gamers who want to explore new and interesting games, showcasing your game in a booth in PAX is definitely the best way to reveal it to the world.</p>

Usually they feature some sort of item, or are used to convey ideas to others, but for me it was more of a way to describe who I was as a person.</p>

<p>A landing page's design reflects an individual's sense of design and well, my sense of design has changed for the better over the course of my life. I look back to some designs I made in the past and those designs at the time were perfect in my own eyes, but of course when I look back to them now I see a lot of errors. Who am I kidding, those designs were pretty bad at that point in time, but it is from those designs which have developed my understanding of creativity which bring me to where I am today.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/FPYYXM0.png" alt="Development of my Landing Page"></p>

<p>This is the first landing page that I created (~2014). It was simple and that's what I liked about it at the time, but there were a few issues already present in the image. First of all, the text rendering on it was for some reason not quite right. The edges look very jagged so it might be a problem with the font I used (Oswald) but I'm not too sure. Alongside that, I loved using negative letter-spacing which may have looked nice at the time, however leads to readability issues later on.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vOKlubq.png" alt="Development of my Landing Page"></p>

<p>This was the second design I came up with. I had just discovered the use of stock photos to 'enhance' my landing page's design and I was into the glass aspect of many things, including Windows Aero's glass taskbars and such. I didn't have too much of a problem with this design, however it was slowly drifting away from my original idea of my homepage, which was a simplistic representation of myself. The stock photo also didn't really convey anything, so that was quite useless although it looked nice.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YorwrUt.png" alt="Development of my Landing Page"></p>

<p>Ah, finally onto my current landing page. It takes the overall theme of my first landing page design and adapts upon that. I took what I had learned already about design and from that, this version of my landing page was formed. Some of these ideas helped me with the page itself, for example I stuck by the idea that <strong>white-space is key for clarity</strong>. I give everything a lot of breathing room so that it's not too crowded with information and so your eyes can move from one section of the page to another easily. </p>

<p>I also <strong>under-utilized colours</strong> on the page as colour is a very difficult concept to work with design-wise. This was taken from <a href="https://medium.com/@erikdkennedy/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-1-559d4e805cda?hn=1">7 Rules for creating gorgeous UI</a> by Erik D Kennedy. In his second rule, he states <strong>black and white first</strong>, then afterwards add colour. This helps to add an accent to the page and I guess keep the design clean, as over-usage of colours results in your brain trying to interpret too many ideas at once. This is evident in my second landing page, where the stock photo distracts the user from what the landing page is actually trying to portray/show.</p>

<p>This design is by no means the last design I will create, as design is always open for improvement and as I improve I will start to notice problems in my own design. For now however, I'm content with what I've made and only time will tell how well the page ages.</p>

<p>A few years back and I never would have thought of making a blog. The whole concept of writing in an area where no one dwells upon is mysterious and intriguing. It forced the question I had to answer for myself, who am I really writing for? I kept asking, all the bloggers out there, all the content writers, why did they write? I knew some wrote for fun, whereas others wrote for themselves. Here's my take on why I started my blog, and why I personally write.</p>

<p>It wasn't until recently, that I realised not everything needed a specific purpose. Articles that are written don't need an immediate effect on the world or anyone, for that fact. Just because something is unknown, doesn't mean that it is of no value, an example being tutorials. I see many of these tutorials, buried away in the abyss and having never been seen by anyone. It doesn't matter that no one has currently seen it, that isn't important. In fact, if it was written to be seen then a blog won't be as effective as other sources. What is important is that someone, whether it be one person or a few, will see it eventually, whether by accident or on purpose. It is at that time that it will gain value.</p>

<p>Those tutorials I stumbled upon, they were from various other bloggers who didn't have a big audience. But did that matter? Those tutorials were of value to me, they provided information that I needed and I am thankful for that. I plan to write on this blog about my experiences while I went through programming or just life in general. Whether or not it is seen is of no matter, but if my posts help others with their problems then it's all for the better.</p>
